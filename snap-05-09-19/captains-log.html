				The unexpected is our normal routine. I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. Besides, you look good in a dress. How long can two people talk about nothing? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canap√©s? Are you up for promotion? Wouldn't that bring about chaos? You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. Talk about going nowhere fast.
